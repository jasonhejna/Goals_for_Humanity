README

Goalsforhumanity is our first project... it's a ranking system that allows anyone to rank goals for humanity. Although we are planning on making Goals For America too. And releasing the code so anyone may create a goals for _____ for their region, city, state, country, etc.

You can check out a demo of the front-end at goalsforhumanity.com (login:"obi",password:"obiwan).

This build is meant to handle all back end web services for ranking things with the ELO ratings system (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

This system also incorporates security considerations arrising from allowing anyone in the world to submit results.

This system tracks all relevent data in a database. Using PHP, MySQL, and CodeIgniter on the backend.

Front End Developer Documentation (partially complete) is available here... https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8s5aHaP98yTLttItqdEebeX8AWatt6NOkME5zVN3NY/edit?usp=sharing
